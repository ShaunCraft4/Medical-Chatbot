# Medical-Chatbot
A Python-based medical Chatbot! (It's a simple chabot that only has access to diagnose a few diseases and it's also my first chatbot, so it isn't as efficient as you would think it is)


How to open the chatbot:

1]To open the chatbot, go to the "SPARK-X-2023" file, then click the "SPARK_X_page_1.py" file, and run the file.

2]Please keep in mind that you might have to install a few modules required for the program. For that please use the "pip install" command in the python console.
