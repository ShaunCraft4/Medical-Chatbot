# Medical-Chatbot
A python based medical Chatbot! (Its a simple chabot which only has access to diagnose a few diseases and its also my first chatbot so it isnt as efficient as you would think it is)

Requirments:
1]Once zip file is downloaded, extract the file.
2]After extracting it, go to your local disc "C", then users, then create a file there named "shaun"
3]Within the "shaun" file create a file named "Downloads"
4]Now go back to the extracted file and double click it. You will see a file named "SPARK-X-2023"
5]Now copy the file and paste it into the newly created "Downloads" file.
6]Make sure to give the file all permission, as to avoid certain errors within the command prompt section. This can be done through the properties tab which can be accessed by right clicking the "SPARK-X-2023" file.
7]After all of this is done, to open the chatbot, go to the "SPARK-X-2023" file, then double click it, then double click the "dist" file, after wards, double click the "SPARK_X_page_1.py" file.
8]If you wish, you can make a shortcut for it to your taskbar.
